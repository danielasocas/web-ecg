# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to compile the example
# program in this directory.  Since this program is intended for instruction
# rather than `production' use, this `makefile' does not include a procedure
# for installing it.  To compile the example, just type `make' (from within
# this directory);  the executable file will be left in this directory.  Type
# `make clean' to remove it.
