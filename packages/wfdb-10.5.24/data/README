file: README		G. Moody	9 August 1989
			Last revised:	 21 July 1999

This directory contains a "micro-database" which can be used to test programs
compiled with the WFDB library, as well as header files for piped and local
records, and for direct input from 9-track tapes, as described in the WFDB
Programmer's Guide.  Note that these files are readable by both UNIX and MS-DOS
versions of the WFDB software.  To make the files in this directory accessible
to such programs, add the name of this directory to the database path, or copy
them into a directory which is already in the database path (for more
information, see the WFDB Programmer's Guide).
	
Most of the *.hea files in this directory duplicate those in the `udb'
directory of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database CD-ROM.  The other files in this
directory are:

Makefile	`make' description file for installing these files
Makefile.top	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (comments only)
Makefile.tpl	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (portable section)
README		this file

100s.hea	header file for record `100s'
100s.dat	signal file for record `100s'
100s.atr	reference annotation file for record `100s'

multi.hea	header file for record `multi'
null.hea	header file for record `null'

wfdbcal		sample WFDB calibration file

dblist		list of databases (see ../doc/ecgeval.1)
ahalist		list of records in the AHA DB
ahaxlist	as above, excluding paced records
culist		list of records in the CU DB
esclist		list of records in the European ST-T DB
mitlist		list of records in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia DB
mitxlist	as above, excluding paced records
nstlist		list of records in the NST DB

Note that there are no signal or annotation files associated with `multi.hea'
and `null.hea';  see the comments in these files for details.
