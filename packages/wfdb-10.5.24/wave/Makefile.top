# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to compile and install WAVE.
# WAVE can be compiled and run only on UNIX systems, although any networked
# system with an X11 server can be used to view its output;  suitable servers
# are available for MS-DOS, the Macintosh, and VAX VMS as well as UNIX.
# In order to compile WAVE, you must have already installed the X11 Xlib
# (libX11.a), XView (libxview.a), and WFDB (libwfdb.a) libraries, and their
# associated header files (in /usr/include/X11, /usr/include/xview, and
# /usr/include/ecg respectively).  The WFDB library source is included with the
# WAVE distribution (in the `lib' directory at the same level as this one).
# Xlib and XView are freely available by anonymous FTP as parts of the X11R4
# distribution from expo.lcs.mit.edu and other sites, or from the MIT Software
# Distribution Center, MIT Room E32-300, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; telephone
# +1-617-253-6966.  See the main help file (wave.hl0, in this directory) for
# further information.
#
# Before using this file for the first time, check that the site-specific
# variables below are appropriate for your system.  To build and install WAVE,
# just type `make' (from within this directory).
