# Custom annotation definitions

# This is an example of how user-defined annotations can be added to WAVE's
# repertoire.  Set the X resource `wave.anntab' (or `Wave.Anntab'), or the
# environment variable ANNTAB, to the pathname of this file before starting
# WAVE in order to load these definitions.  If you do so, any annotation
# files that you create or edit using WAVE will include appropriate
# modification labels so that other DB applications will interpret these
# definitions properly.

# Once again, these are EXAMPLES!  You almost certainly don't want to use these
# definitions in your own annotation files :-)

# Each definition should be on a line by itself.  Definitions must contain
# three fields separated by spaces or tabs.  The first field is the (decimal)
# annotation code (see <ecg/ecgcodes.h> for a list of predefined codes).  The
# second field is the mnemonic for the annotation, as it will appear on-screen.
# It is a bad idea, though not illegal, to use the same mnemonic for more than
# one code, but doing so is certain to create confusion, so don't.  It is a
# good idea to use a single-character mnemonic, since you will then be able
# to type it into the signal window in order to reset the annotation type
# (rather than having to use the popup menu to select it).  The third field,
# which extends to the end of the line and may include whitespace, contains the
# description of the annotation that appears in the popup menu;  keep it
# short, to avoid making the menu too wide for your screen.

# lines must begin with `#'.
