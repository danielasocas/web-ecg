_______________________________________________________________________________

This directory contains sources for `wave', an X11/XView-based program for
analyzing and viewing database records and editing annotation files.  For more
information about `wave', read the WAVE User's Guide at
   http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wug/
Sources for the WAVE User's Guide can be found in '../doc'.  Other sources of
information include on-line text help (type `make help' in this directory) and
the WAVE 'man' page (type 'man wave' once this package has been installed,
or see `wave.1' in '../doc'.  Read `Makefile' in this directory for information
about compiling and installing `wave'.

WAVE was originally developed under SunOS;  since 1994, its development has
been continued under GNU/Linux.  WAVE currently runs on FreeBSD, Mac OS X,
MS-Windows (with Cygwin), and Solaris, in addition to GNU/Linux.  It has
proven very easy to port (typically just a recompile is required) to any
platform for which the XView toolkit is available.

The following files will be found in this directory:

Makefile	UNIX `make' description file for compiling WAVE
Makefile.top	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (comments only)
Makefile.tpl	Used by ../configure to construct Makefile (portable section)
README		this file

analyze.c	analysis functions
annot.c		annotation list handling and display functions
annpan.c	functions for the annotation template panel
anntab		examples of user-defined annotation types
bitmaps.h	icon and cursor bitmaps
buttons.hlp	on-line help for command buttons
demo.txt	information text for WAVE demo mode
edit.c		annotation-editing functions
editing.hlp	on-line help for editing functions

intro.hlp	on-line overview of `wave'
log.hlp		on-line help for log functions
logpan.c	functions for the log panel
mainpan.c	functions for the main control panel
mglass_mask.xbm	bitmap mask for spot help magnifying glass icon
mglass.xbm	bitmap for spot help magnifying glass icon
modepan.c	functions for the mode panel
nomake		dummy 'Makefile' used by ../configure if XView is missing
		 (WAVE cannot be compiled in this case)

wave.hl0	template for comprehensive help file
wave.info	XView spot help file (generated by ../doc/wave/fixinfo)
wave.prf	template for `About WAVE ...' message
wave.xbm	bitmap for WAVE icon
wavemenu.def	default analysis menu
xview-patches	optional patches to be applied to XView *.h files (to avoid
                 warnings from gcc; read the file to see how to use it)
xvwave.c	XView support functions
xvwave.h	XView constants, macros, global variables, and function
		 prototypes

What next?
----------

The `Makefile' in this directory can be used to automate compilation and
installation of `wave'.  Normally this is done by a nested `make' invoked
from within the `makefile' in the `wfdb' directory (the parent of this one).
See the `README' file in that directory for further information.

Your comments and suggestions are welcome;  please send them to me at the
address above, by e-mail if possible.

If you use WAVE remotely, reports of window manager, X server, or network
software incompatibilities (or compatibilities!) would be greatly appreciated.
If you attempt to port WAVE to a new environment, please write to me to be
sure of getting the most recent sources and to avoid duplication of effort in
case your port is in progress or already finished.
