WAVE logs are text files, in the format used by `pschart' and `psfd' script
files.  Typically, logs contain notes about interesting sections of one or more
records.  Each entry (line) in a WAVE log contains a record name, a time
reference, and a comment.  Using the `Log ...' window (accessed from the `File'
menu of WAVE's main control panel), you may create or review logs, and add,
modify, or delete entries in them.  Within the WAVE menu, the name of the
current log file can be represented as `$LOG';  this feature may be used to
write WAVE extensions that extract or print segments of interest.

When the log panel is first opened, most of its controls are disabled.  You
must specify a name for the log before you can use any of these controls.
Do so by typing the name into the `File:' field;  press RETURN to tell WAVE
to accept the name.  If the log exists already, WAVE reads its contents and
shows you its first entry.  If the log does not exist, WAVE creates an empty
log with the name you have chosen.  The other controls are enabled as
appropriate (for example, the `Delete' button is not enabled unless there is
an entry to delete).

The `Description:' field contains the description associated with the current
log entry.

The buttons of the log panel are:

 Load		WAVE reads the log file into memory, after saving the current
		contents as a backup file if any changes were made since it
		was most recently loaded.  Use this button to read a log
	        file generated by another process, such as a WAVE analysis
		menu button.

 Add		WAVE adds an entry containing the record name and the contents
		of the description field to the log file.  If an annotation or
		marker within the signal window has been selected (i.e., if it
		is shown marked with a box), WAVE records the time of that
		annotation in the log entry;  when the entry is redisplayed,
		WAVE selects the same annotation again.  Otherwise, WAVE
		records the times in the lower left and right corners of the
		signal window.

 Replace	WAVE replaces the description attached to the current log
		entry with the current contents of the description field.  It
		does not create a new entry (use the `Add' button for that
		purpose).

 Delete		WAVE deletes the current entry from the log, and displays the
		next entry if it exists.

 Edit		This button is currently non-functional.

 |<		WAVE shows the first log entry.

 <<		WAVE reviews each entry in the log file in reverse order,
		pausing 5 seconds between entries.  While a review is in
		progress, only the Pause button is enabled.

 <		WAVE shows the previous log entry.

 Pause		WAVE stops the log review that was begun by the `<<' or `>>'
		button.  This button is disabled unless a review is in
		progress.

 >		WAVE shows the next log entry.

 >>		WAVE reviews each entry in the log file, pausing 5 seconds
		between entries.  While a review is in progress, only the
		Pause button is enabled.

 >|		WAVE shows the last log entry.
