Before You Begin
================

WAVE is a very powerful and flexible tool with a user interface that is easy
to learn once you are familiar with the style of interaction common to other X
applications.  To a significant extent, the "look and feel" of WAVE is
determined by your choice of window manager and preferences.  If you have not
used the X Window System before, you should study the documentation that
describes your system's X server and window manager.  You should also find out
how to simulate the possible actions of a three-button mouse if you do not
have one (servers often provide keyboard/mouse combinations for this purpose).
The remainder of this guide assumes that you know:
 - how to log onto a system on which WAVE has already been installed;
 - how to start an X application; and
 - how to use the mouse.

If you are planning to run WAVE remotely (i.e., if the display and
keyboard in front of you do not belong to the system on which WAVE runs,
but instead belong to another system on the same network), you may need
to perform a few preparatory steps.  See `How can I use WAVE from an X
terminal/PC/Mac/etc?' in the WAVE FAQ for details.

Before running WAVE for the first time with a given X server, you may wish to
calibrate your display so that WAVE can draw signals at the proper scales.
See `How can I get correct display scales?' in the WAVE FAQ for details.

In common with other WFDB applications, WAVE locates signal, annotation, and
header files by searching for them in a user-definable sequence of locations
(the WFDB path).  By default, the WFDB path includes the current directory,
/usr/database, and http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database (PhysioBank).
If you keep data files that you wish to read using WAVE in other locations,
be sure to set the WFDB path appropriately.  Bourne shell, Korn shell, and
`bash' users can often do so by typing `. setwfdb';  C-shell users should type
`source /PATH/TO/cshsetwfdb' (where /PATH/TO is usually one of the directories
in the shell's own PATH, often /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin).  See the WFDB
Programmer's Guide or the WFDB Applications Guide, or type `man setwfdb' for
details.

Starting WAVE
=============

From within a terminal window for the system on which WAVE resides, type:
	wave -r RECORD OPTIONS
where RECORD is the WFDB record name and OPTIONS can include any of the
optional arguments listed below, or none of them.  Separate arguments
with spaces, and execute the command by pressing RETURN (or ENTER, etc.).

Options:
--------
 -a ANNOTATOR		Open the specified annotation file for the previously
			specified RECORD.
 -dpi XX[xYY]		Calibrate WAVE for a display with a resolution of
			XX (by YY) dots per inch.
 -f TIME		Open the previously specified RECORD at TIME.
 -g			Use shades of grey only (even on a color monitor).
 -m			Use black and white only (even on color or grayscale
			monitors).
 -O			Use overlay graphics (for the fastest and best-quality
			graphics on displays that support this mode)
 -s SIGNAL [SIGNAL ...] Initialize the signal list to the specified SIGNAL(s).
 -S			Use the standard (shared) color palette (even if it
			is possible to modify the palette).
 -D LOGFILE		Start WAVE in `demo' mode (see below).
 -V...			Specify initial values for the settings controlled
			from the `View' panel (see `Resources' for details).
Examples:
---------
 wave -r 200 -a atr		Open record 200, and show annotations from
				the reference annotation file (200.atr)

 wave -r 100 -g -dpi 65x70	Open record 100, and use shades of grey only
				on a display that has a resolution of 65 dpi
				horizontally by 70 dpi vertically

WAVE queries the X server to determine the display capabilities and resolution;
it is not necessary to use the -g, -m, or -S options unless you wish to
restrict WAVE's use of the available capabilities.  The -O option exists only
to force use of overlay mode if another mode has been set as the default (see
`Setting WAVE Resources' below);  usually, overlay mode is the default.  Use
-dpi only if the X server does not have, and cannot be supplied, the correct
information about the display resolution.

In `demo' mode, WAVE displays the strips specified in LOGFILE, pausing for 5
seconds after each display.  All of WAVE's controls operate in normal fashion
while `demo' mode is active.  To exit `demo' mode without exiting from WAVE,
call up the `Log...' window from the `File' menu and press the `Pause' button.
You can return to `demo' mode by pressing the `Review log' button.  (See `WAVE
Logs', below, for information on creating a LOGFILE.)

See the WAVE FAQ if you have difficulty getting started.

Using WAVE
==========

After typing a command to start WAVE, as described above, the main window
of WAVE should appear on your display.  (Some window managers may require
you to specify the placement or sizing of a new window before it appears.
In this case, you may see an outline of the window, or the cursor shape may
change, and you must use the mouse to open the window.  This behaviour is
beyond the control of WAVE.)

Move the mouse so that the pointer lies within the WAVE main window.  (Again,
depending on your window manager, you may have to set the input focus
explicitly before proceeding.  Typically, you may have to click the left
mouse button with the pointer within the window in order to do so.)  Once
the WAVE main window has the input focus, the buttons in the main control
panel (at the top of the window) can be used to control WAVE.

Some of WAVE's panels contain regions marked by underlines for entry of text.
By positioning the pointer near any of the underlined entries and clicking the
left mouse button, you can set a text cursor that appears above the underline.
You may delete characters to the left of the text cursor using the DELETE key,
or you may type into the entry.  If you press RETURN, your changes take effect
immediately;  you may change two or more entries without pressing RETURN, and
the effects of the changes will be deferred until you press RETURN or select
one of the buttons on the panel.  To select a panel button, position the
pointer on the button and click the left mouse button.  If the button label
includes a menu indicator (a downward- or rightward-pointing triangle), you
may pop up the menu by pressing the right mouse button;  drag the pointer to
the desired choice on the menu and release the right mouse button, or move the
pointer off of the menu before releasing the right mouse button if you do not
wish to choose any of the menu items.
