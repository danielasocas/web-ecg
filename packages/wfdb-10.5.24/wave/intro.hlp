WAVE: Waveform Analyzer, Viewer, and Editor

Copyright (C) 1990-2010 George B. Moody

WAVE is an extensible interactive graphical environment for manipulating sets
of digitized signals with optional annotations.  WAVE is built using the WFDB
library developed for physiologic signal processing, so it can be applied to
any of a wide variety of data formats supported by the WFDB library.  WAVE can
run on FreeBSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, MS-Windows with Cygwin, Solaris, and
other platforms that support the X Window System and the free XView toolkit.

Among WAVE's capabilities are:
 - fast display of waveforms and annotations at various calibrated scales
 - fast access to any portion of a recording, with caching and `read-ahead'
   heuristics to improve efficiency and reduce network traffic
 - forward and backward searches for annotation patterns
 - graphical annotation editing using standard or user-defined annotations
 - variable-speed superimposition display (simulation of triggered oscilloscope
   display with persistence;  can be run forward or backward)
 - high-resolution printing of user-selected signal segments
 - extremely flexible control of external signal-processing and analysis
   programs (menus may be reconfigured by the user while WAVE is running)
 - on-line `spot' help for all controls, with additional topic-oriented on-line
   help

Move the mouse pointer over any control and press the HELP key (or F1 if there
is no HELP key) for information about that control.  (If your window manager
does not cooperate, this may not work;  in that case, select `Buttons' from the
`Help Topics' panel for information about controls.)

The answers to many frequently asked questions about WAVE can be found in
the WAVE FAQ (http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wug/wave-faq.htm), which
is part of the WAVE User's Guide (http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wug/),
a book-length tutorial and reference manual for WAVE.
