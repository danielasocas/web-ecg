There are three ways to print annotated signals from WAVE:

1. From the File menu, select `Print'.  This produces a `chart recorder' format
   copy of the contents of the Signal window.
2. From the File menu, select `Analyze...' and then `Print chart' from the
   Analyze window.
3. From the File menu, select `Analyze...' and then `Print full disclosure'
   from the Analyze window.

If you choose either of the last two methods, you should first select the
portion of the record you wish to print, either by entering the times directly
in the `Start' and `End' fields of the Analyze window, or by inserting `<' and
`>' markers at the beginning and end of the segment to be printed.

Printing is performed by spawning a `pschart' or `psfd' process (after saving
any edits).  In general, the output has higher resolution than is possible on
screen.
