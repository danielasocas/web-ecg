 File		Press the right mouse button to bring up the File menu, which
		includes:
	Load...		Select this item to bring up the Load window;  change
			the `Record' or `Annotator' fields in the Load window
			in order to load a different record or annotation file.
			The initial values of these fields are obtained from
			the -r and -a options on the command line.  If the
			`Annotator' field is empty, no annotations are loaded.
	Save		Select this item to force your edits to be written to
			disk files.  (This is done automatically after every
			20 edits, any time the record or annotator is changed,
			and upon exiting WAVE.)
	Print		Select this item to print the contents of the ECG
			window in chart recorder format (after saving any
			edits).  This is accomplished by spawning a `pschart'
			process, so you need not wait for the output before
			continuing.  Output from multiple print requests
			appears in the order in which the requests were made.
 	Analyze...	Select this item to bring up the Analyze panel and the
			Analysis commands window; use the buttons in the panel
			to analyze the record, or type a command directly into
			the Analysis commands window.  The names of most of the
			buttons and their assigned actions are read from a menu
			file (by default, /usr/local/lib/wavemenu.def; 	this
			may be overridden by setting the environment variable
			WAVEMENU to the name of a different file).  The buttons
			are usually configured to perform various analysis
			functions on the current record; read the default menu
			file for details.
	Log...		Select this item to bring up the Log window.  Change
			the `Log file name' field to load a log file;  enter
			text to be recorded in the log file in the
			`Description' field.  Record an entry by pressing the
			`Save' button, or dismiss the window without logging
			the entry by pressing `Cancel'.  Review the entries
			by pressing `Review log';  each entry will be displayed
			for 5 seconds unless you press `Pause' (disabled except
			while reviewing the log).  Each entry contains the
			record name, the times shown at the lower left and
			right corners of the ECG window, and the contents of
			the `Description' field.  Log files may be used as
			command scripts for `pschart'.  You may write to as
			many log files in a single session as you choose, and
			you may accumulate entries from multiple sessions in a
			single log file.

 View...	Press the left mouse button to bring up the View window, which
		includes:
	Show:		Select one or more of these items in order to enable
			or disable optional elements of the ECG display.
	Time scale:	Press the right mouse button to view the list of
			available time scales;  drag the pointer to the
			desired scale and release the right mouse button.
	Amplitude scale:
			Press the right mouse button to view the list of
			available amplitude scales;  drag the pointer to the
			desired scale and release the right mouse button.
	Draw:		Press the right mouse button to select either `all
			signals' or `listed signals only'.  If you choose
			`listed signals only', signals are displayed in the
			order specified in the signal list on the `Analyze'
			panel, and any signals not included in the list are
			not displayed.
	Grid:		Press the right mouse button to view the list of
			available grid types;  drag the pointer to the
			desired type and release the right mouse button.
	Undo changes	Select this item to restore the View window indicators
			to match the current state of the ECG window.
	Redraw		Select this item to apply any changes you have made
			and to dismiss the View window.

 Edit		Press the right mouse button to bring up the Edit menu, which
		includes:
	Allow editing	Select this item if you wish to make changes in the
			annotation file.
	View only	Select this item if you do not wish to edit the
			annotation file any longer.  By default, editing is
			disabled when WAVE is started up.

 Properties	Press the right mouse button to bring up the Properties menu,
		which includes:
	Signals...	Select this item to view information about the ECG
			signals in the current record.
	Annotations...	Select this item to view a summary of the contents of
			the current annotation file.
	About WAVE...	Select this item to view information about the version
			number and installation date of this version of WAVE.

 < Search	Search backwards, beginning with the annotation that
		immediately precedes the earliest annotation currently
		displayed, for an annotation that matches the entry in the
		"Search for" field of the Find window (see below).  The display
		is redrawn, roughly centered on the matching annotation.

 <<		Skip backwards by an amount equal to the duration of the
		signals currently displayed (i.e., a full screen).

 <		Skip backwards by one-half screen.

 Find...	Press the left mouse button to bring up the Find window, which
		includes:
	Start time:	The value of this item is the time shown in the lower
			left corner of the ECG window.  Change it in order to
			view another part of the record.  (Time can be entered
			in h:m:s format, with hours or hours and minutes
			omitted, or in sNNNNN format, in which NNNNN is a
			number of sample intervals from the beginning of the
			record.  Time is always rounded down to an even
			multiple of one second, and is displayed in m:s or
			h:m:s format irrespective of the input format once the
			display is refreshed.)
	End time:	Similarly, this item's value is the time shown in the
			lower right corner of the ECG window.  Change it in
			order to view another part of the record.  If you
			change both the Start time and the End time fields
			without pressing RETURN in between, only the last
			change is effective.  To change the duration of the
			ECG window, select the View window (see above) and
			change the time scale.
	Search for:	This entry is initially empty.  Enter a string to
			specify a search target for the "< Search" and
			"Search >" buttons.  The string should match an
			annotation or marker mnemonic, signal quality code,
			rhythm, comment, or other text string, or one of:
			  *v	to match any ventricular ectopic beat
			  *s	to match any supraventricular ectopic beat
			  *n	to match any other beat type
			  *	to match any annotation or marker
			  .	to match a deletion made during this edit

 >		Skip forwards by one-half screen.

 >>		Skip forwards by a full screen.

 Search >	Search forwards, beginning with the annotation that
		immediately follows the last annotation currently displayed,
		for an annotation that matches the entry in the "Search for"
		field of the Find window (see above).  The display is redrawn,
		roughly centered on the matching annotation.

 Help		This button pops up a panel containing buttons that name
		several topics for which extensive on-line help is available.
		Choosing a topic allows you to browse through the associated
		help file in a scrollable text window.

 Quit		WAVE exits when you press this button, after saving your edits
		if any.  If your input file would be overwritten as a result of
		saving your edits, it is first renamed by appending a `~' to
		the annotator name.  If you have entered annotations but have
		not specified an annotator, the name by which you invoked this
		program (normally, `wave') is used for the annotator name.
