# This file is used with the UNIX `make' command to compile the example
# programs from the WFDB Programmer's Guide, for which the sources can be
# found in this directory.  Since these programs are intended for instruction
# rather than `production' use, this `makefile' does not include a procedure
# for installing them.  To compile the examples, just type `make' (from within
# this directory);  the executable files will be left in this directory.  Type
# `make clean' to remove them.
